# Shopping_Cart
Developed a Shopping Cart application in Java, incorporating Hibernate and Spring MVC frameworks. Implemented user-friendly features such as secure authentication, seamless cart management, and responsive UI. Ensured optimal database operations and applied best practices for scalability and performance. 
The Shopping Cart project using Spring MVC, JSP, Hibernate in Java, HTML, CSS, and MySQL database is a web application aimed at facilitating online shopping. Here's a brief description of each component:

1. Merchant: Represents sellers or vendors who offer products for sale. Merchants can add, update, or remove products from their inventory.

2. Customer: Represents users who browse and purchase products from the online store. Customers can register, login, browse products, add them to their cart, and place orders.

3. Product: Represents items available for purchase. Each product has attributes such as name, description, price, and quantity in stock.

4. Cart: Represents the shopping cart where customers can add products they intend to purchase. It holds information about the selected items and their quantities.

5. Items: Represents individual products added to the cart. It contains information like the product ID, quantity, and associated cart ID.

6. Orders: Represents completed purchases. When a customer places an order, it gets recorded with details like order ID, customer ID, products purchased, total amount, and order status.

The technologies used in the project are as follows:

=> Spring MVC: Provides a robust framework for building web applications in Java. It facilitates the separation of concerns by following the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.

=> JSP (JavaServer Pages): Used for rendering dynamic content in web pages. JSP allows embedding Java code within HTML pages, enabling dynamic generation of content.

=> Hibernate: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for Java that simplifies database interaction by mapping Java objects to database tables. It provides a way to persist and retrieve objects from the database without writing SQL queries explicitly.

=> HTML and CSS: HTML is used for creating the structure of web pages, while CSS is used for styling them. Together, they provide the visual representation of the web application.

=> MySQL Database: Used as the backend database management system to store information about users, products, orders, etc. MySQL is widely used for its reliability, scalability, and performance.

The project allows customers to browse products, add them to the cart, and place orders securely. Merchants can manage their inventory by adding new products, updating existing ones, or removing them as needed. The integration of Spring MVC, JSP, Hibernate, HTML, CSS, and MySQL ensures a robust and user-friendly shopping experience for both customers and merchants.
